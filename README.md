# data-structures
Collection of data structures and algortithms implemented in C

# shearsort
Shearsort algorithm implementation with multiple threads and synchronization

# mmap
Using memory mapping and semaphores to 'add' and 'allocate' units of certain resources that are held in a table

# dir traversal
Designed to be similar to the -ls lRa command. Also displays file/dir/link inode propeties

# battleship
Found an old Battleship Game I programmed using C to run on the command line. 
Has some obvious beginner-looking code (large functions, strange loop iterations) in it but it was my first real project while learning the language.
